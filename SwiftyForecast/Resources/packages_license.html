copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>
<p>“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>

this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>

institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
meet the following conditions:</p>

that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its<br>
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>

except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS,<br>
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
